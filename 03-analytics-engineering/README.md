# NYC Taxi Trips Analytics ‚Äì dbt + Postgres + Metabase

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, Module 4: Analytics Engineering.  
The goal is to transform raw NYC taxi data into clean analytical models using **dbt Core** with **PostgreSQL** as the data warehouse and **Metabase** for visualization.

All development was done **locally**, following **Alternative B**: dbt Core with Postgres and Metabase using `metabase.jar`.

## Tech Stack

- **dbt Core** (local installation)
- **PostgreSQL** (running locally via Docker)
- **Metabase** (running locally via JAR file)
- **Docker** for environment isolation

## Project Structure

- `models/staging/`: Raw data cleaning and standardization
- `fact_trips.sql`: Combines Yellow and Green taxi trips with location dimensions
- `dim_zones.sql`: Dimension table for pickup/dropoff zones

## Data Sources

- Green Taxi Trips: 2019‚Äì2020
- Yellow Taxi Trips: 2019‚Äì2020
- FHV Trips: 2019

All data was ingested and cleaned in Week 3 pipelines and loaded into PostgreSQL.

## Visualizations (via Metabase)

### 1. **Top Drop-off Locations**

**Conclusion:**  
This donut chart visualizes the distribution of taxi trips in New York City, showing that Yellow taxis accounted for the majority of trips (86.5%), while Green taxis made up only 13.5%, with a total of 4.1 million trips.

- The transportation service has generated a total revenue of $63,956,015 from 6,201,387 customers.
- Most transactions occur on Tuesday, indicating a peak in demand on that day.
- The majority of trips (86.5%) are serviced by yellow taxis, with a total of 4.1 million trips.
- Credit card is the most preferred payment method, followed by cash.

This shows that Yellow taxis were far more commonly used during this time period, which may reflect factors such as availability, service area coverage, or customer preference.

## üó∫Ô∏è Drop-off Distribution Analysis

This analysis segments drop-off location IDs into bins of 50 and identifies the most common zones and boroughs within each range.

| Dropoff ID Range | Trip Count | Dominant Zone        | Dominant Borough |
|------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| 0‚Äì50             | 22         | Central Harlem        | Manhattan        |
| 50‚Äì100           | 23         | East Harlem North     | Manhattan        |
| 100‚Äì150          | 17         | Greenpoint            | Manhattan        |
| 150‚Äì200          | 17         | Park Slope            | Manhattan        |
| 200‚Äì250          | 19         | Sheepshead Bay        | Brooklyn         |
| 250‚Äì300          | 2          | Yorkville East        | Manhattan        |

### üìä Conclusion

- The highest number of trips occurred in the 50‚Äì100 ID range, particularly in East Harlem North (Manhattan).
- Most drop-offs are concentrated in Manhattan, indicating high passenger activity.
- Brooklyn only appears once as a dominant borough (Sheepshead Bay).
- Yorkville East in Manhattan had the fewest drop-offs in this dataset.

## üîç Summary

- **Tuesday** has the highest number of trips (over 500).
- **Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday** have moderate trip counts (around 50‚Äì100).
- **Sunday and Wednesday** show very low activity.

## üí° Business Insight

- The spike on **Tuesday** could indicate peak demand or a **data anomaly**.
- Recommended actions:
  - ‚úÖ Verify data for duplicates or incorrect labels.
  - ‚úÖ If valid, consider allocating **more taxis on Tuesdays** or running **special promotions**.
